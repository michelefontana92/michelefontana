abstract: We describe our approach and experiments to tackle Task A of the second edition of HaSpeeDe, within the Evalita 2020 evaluation campaign. The proposed model consists in an ensemble of classifiers built from three variants of a common neural architecture. Each classifier uses contextual representations from transformers trained on Italian texts, fine tuned on the training set of the challenge. We tested the proposed model on the two official test sets, the in-domain test set containing just tweets and the out-of-domain one including also news headlines. Our submissions ranked 4th on the tweets test set and 17th on the second test set.
